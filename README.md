This repository contains the Jupyter notebook done as a part of the Coursera course 'Python Projects for Data Science'

As part of the course, libraries in Python such as requests, Beautiful Soup, yfinance and pandas have been use to accomplish the following
- Webscraping to get information from different websites
- Access financial information using the yfinance library
- Create dataframes containing the information related to revenues of stocks which can then be plotting into graphs for visual data representation
